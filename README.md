# Trade-offs for climate-smart forestry in Europe under uncertain future climate

This repository contains the optimization code for the Gregor et al. (2022) paper.


Please refer to the jupyter notebook 'full_analysis_one_cell_paper.ipynb'. There you can compute the inputs to the robust optimization from the LPJ-GUESS outputs of four example grid cells provided in this repository. The notebook also offers the possibility to actually run the optimization for those grid cells and compute the portfolios.

The complete LPJ-GUESS outputs for all the grid cells are provided elsewhere (see statement in the paper). With that data and the code provided here, all the figures of the paper can be reproduced.
